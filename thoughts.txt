firebase database user tree is sorted by phone number
then it has a name,
then it has a status valuem,
then a list of phone numbers.

EXAMPLE
database\users\
20391830
- name:"Lars Larsen"
- status:0
- contacts:
--29838888,
--39492830,
--83920974

STATUS VARIBLE
-1: Not using COVID-19 NSCU [BLUE]
0: No sympoms on COVID-19 [GREEN]
1: Recovered from COVID-19 [PINK]
2: Tested Positive with COVID-19 [RED]
3: Has symptoms on COVID-19 [YELLOW]

When a user registers it should automaticly create a new user in the database
The user register simply with their phone number and a password for security,
you might argue that a password security is not needed, but considering the fact that
the users contact list is stored in the database, it would be a good idea. (i might be 
wrong though)

The way that the app checks for statuses in the users social network is by using a list
of phone numbers that the user have created, the app will then check in the global 
users list to check if a user matches the phone number currently searched for by the 
users contact list, if not found in the database, it will go to the next number in
the list of phone numbers. if however a phone number has been found, it will get the 
user data (Name and status value) and the app will use the informaton to display it in 
someway to the current user.

The downside of this is that the check might take a long time to load depending on the
ammount of users in the database, but considering that this is the only working way i 
could think of, theres not much to do.

Maybe there would be a way for users on mobile browsers to check for users on their 
phones contact list.
